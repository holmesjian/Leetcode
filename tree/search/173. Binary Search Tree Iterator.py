# # Problem
# 
# Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
# 
# Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.
# 
# Note:
# 
# next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.<br>
# You may assume that next() call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when next() is called.<br>
