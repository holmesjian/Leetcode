# # Problem
# 
# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
# 
# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
# 
# Search for a node to remove.<br>
# If the node is found, delete the node.<br>
# Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

# # Brainstorm
