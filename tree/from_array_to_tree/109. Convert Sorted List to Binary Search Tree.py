# Approach 1:
# the middle element of the given list would form the root of the binary search tree. All the elements to the left of the middle element would form the left subtree recursively. Similarly, all the elements to the right of the middle element will form the right subtree of the binary search tree. This would ensure the height balance required in the resulting binary search tree.
