    "A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].\n",

    "A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.\n",
    "Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.\n",

    "Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.<br>\n",
