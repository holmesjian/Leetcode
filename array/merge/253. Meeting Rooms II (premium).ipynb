    "If we sort the meetings based on start time, there are several scenarios:\n",
    "- the next meeting does not overlap with the previous meeting, so we don't need to allocate a new room.\n",
    "- the next meeting overlaps with the previous meeting, and there is only 1 meeting happening, we will allocate a new room.\n",
    "- the next meeting overlaps with the previous meeting, but an even earlier meeting has ended, then we don't allocate a new room.\n",
    "- the next meeting overlaps with the previous meeting, all earlier meetings have not ended, then we will allocate a new room.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to keep track of previous meetings' ending time and check an earlier ending meeting and compare it with the current meeting, a min heap could help to reduce time complexicity from O(N^2) to O(N Log N). heap push take logN time. So using heap, the time is dominated by sorting which is O(NlogN). Space is O(N), same as an array.\n"
